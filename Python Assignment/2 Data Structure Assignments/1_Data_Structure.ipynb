    "## 1. Why might you choose a deque from the collections module to implement a queue instead of using a regular Python list?\n",
    "\n",
    "A deque (short for “double-ended queue”) from the collections module is often preferred over a regular Python list for implementing a queue due to its specific advantages:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "*Fast Insertions and Deletions: <br>Deques allow efficient insertions and deletions at both the beginning and the end. In contrast, inserting or removing elements in the middle of a list can be relatively slow because it may require shifting other elements.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "*Random Access:<br> While lists provide random access (i.e., you can access elements by index), deques are still quite efficient for most use cases and offer similar interface methods as lists.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "*Invalidation of Pointers and Iterators:<br> Be aware that any insertion or deletion in a deque (except at the beginning or end) invalidates all pointers, references, and iterators that refer to its elements.\n"
