In a future version, this will no longer exclude empty items when determining the result dtype.

However, there is an inconsistency with the `combine_first` method. It occasionally generates the same `FutureWarning` associated with concatenation, in a manner that may seem perplexing, even when both DataFrames involved in the operation are clearly non-empty. This anomaly can present challenges in preemptively suppressing the warning within one's code without affecting the overall functionality.\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nAvoid confusing warnings\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit                : fd3f57170aa1af588ba877e8e28c158a20a4886d\\r\\npython                : 3.11.6.final.0\\r\\npython-bits           : 64\\r\\nOS                    : Darwin\\r\\nOS-release            : 21.6.0\\r\\nVersion               : Darwin Kernel Version 21.6.0: Wed Aug 10 14:25:27 PDT 2022; root:xnu-8020.141.5~2/RELEASE_X86_64\\r\\nmachine               : x86_64\\r\\nprocessor             : i386\\r\\nbyteorder             : little\\r\\nLC_ALL                : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\nLANG                  : en_US\\r\\nLOCALE                : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\n\\r\\npandas                : 2.2.0\\r\\nnumpy                 : 1.25.2\\r\\npytz                  : 2022.7.1\\r\\ndateutil              : 2.8.2\\r\\nsetuptools            : 67.4.0\\r\\npip                   : 23.0.1\\r\\nCython                : None\\r\\npytest                : None\\r\\nhypothesis            : None\\r\\nsphinx                : None\\r\\nblosc                 : None\\r\\nfeather               : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\r\\nlxml.etree            : 4.9.3\\r\\nhtml5lib              : None\\r\\npymysql               : None\\r\\npsycopg2              : None\\r\\njinja2                : 3.1.2\\r\\nIPython               : 8.12.0\\r\\npandas_datareader     : None\\r\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\r\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\r\\nbs4                   : 4.12.2\\r\\nbottleneck            : None\\r\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\r\\nfastparquet           : None\\r\\nfsspec                : 2023.9.2\\r\\ngcsfs                 : None\\r\\nmatplotlib            : None\\r\\nnumba                 : None\\r\\nnumexpr               : None\\r\\nodfpy                 : None\\r\\nopenpyxl              : 3.1.2\\r\\npandas_gbq            : None\\r\\npyarrow               : 15.0.0\\r\\npyreadstat            : None\\r\\npython-calamine       : None\\r\\npyxlsb                : None\\r\\ns3fs                  : None\\r\\nscipy                 : None\\r\\nsqlalchemy            : None\\r\\ntables                : None\\r\\ntabulate              : None\\r\\nxarray                : None\\r\\nxlrd                  : None\\r\\nzstandard             : None\\r\\ntzdata                : 2023.3\\r\\nqtpy                  : None\\r\\npyqt5                 : None\\r\\n\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n\",\n",

       "  'body': '### Pandas version checks\\n\\n- [X] I have checked that this issue has not already been reported.\\n\\n- [X] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [latest version](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/whatsnew/index.html) of pandas.\\n\\n- [X] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [main branch](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/getting_started/install.html#installing-the-development-version-of-pandas) of pandas.\\n\\n\\n### Reproducible Example\\n\\n```python\\nimport pandas as pd\\r\\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\"a\": [1, 1, 2], \"b\": [3, 4, 5]}).set_index(\"a\")\\r\\ndf.columns = pd.MultiIndex.from_tuples([(\"b\",)])\\r\\n# Works\\r\\ndf.groupby(\"a\")[(\"b\",)].sum()\\r\\n\\r\\ndf.columns = pd.MultiIndex.from_tuples([(\"b\", 1)])\\r\\n# Fails\\r\\ndf.groupby(\"a\")[(\"b\", 1)].sum()\\r\\n# \"ValueError: Cannot subset columns with a tuple with more than one element. Use a list instead.\".\\n```\\n\\n\\n### Issue Description\\n\\nPrior to 1.0.0, passing a multi-element tuple to `DataFrameGroupBy` was treated as passing a list of the tuple elements (e.g., `df_gb[(\"a\", \"b\")] === df_gb[[\"a\", \"b\"]] === df_gb[\"a\", \"b\"]`). The ability to pass multi-element tuples was deprecated with a `FutureWarning` in 1.0.0, and removed in 2.0.0 (see #30546).\\r\\n\\r\\nA related behavior is that passing a tuple to a non-MultiIndexed DataFrame is allowed (see #36302)\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nThere should be no difference between the two examples above. `DataFrameGroupBy.__getitem__(tuple)` should match `DataFrame.__getitem__(tuple)`:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. If `len(tuple) < df.columns.nlevels`, return a `DataGrameGroupBy` selecting the columns that match the first n levels (and reduce the column level depth by `len(tuple)`\\r\\n2. If `len(tuple) == df.columns.nlevels`, return a `SeriesGroupBy`\\r\\n3. If `len(tuple) > df.columns.nlevels`, raise an error.\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit                : b48abb26a93026fe2f889b4169c2189af212b8c7\\r\\npython                : 3.12.2.final.0\\r\\npython-bits           : 64\\r\\nOS                    : Linux\\r\\nOS-release            : 5.15.146.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2\\r\\nVersion               : #1 SMP Thu Jan 11 04:09:03 UTC 2024\\r\\nmachine               : x86_64\\r\\nprocessor             : \\r\\nbyteorder             : little\\r\\nLC_ALL                : None\\r\\nLANG                  : C.UTF-8\\r\\nLOCALE                : C.UTF-8\\r\\n\\r\\npandas                : 3.0.0.dev0+631.gb48abb26a9.dirty\\r\\nnumpy                 : 1.26.4\\r\\npytz                  : 2024.1\\r\\ndateutil              : 2.9.0.post0\\r\\nsetuptools            : 69.2.0\\r\\npip                   : 24.0\\r\\nCython                : 3.0.9\\r\\npytest                : 8.1.1\\r\\nhypothesis            : 6.99.13\\r\\nsphinx                : 7.2.6\\r\\nblosc                 : None\\r\\nfeather               : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter            : 3.2.0\\r\\nlxml.etree            : 5.1.0\\r\\nhtml5lib              : 1.1\\r\\npymysql               : 1.4.6\\r\\npsycopg2              : 2.9.9\\r\\njinja2                : 3.1.3\\r\\nIPython               : 8.22.2\\r\\npandas_datareader     : None\\r\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\r\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\r\\nbs4                   : 4.12.3\\r\\nbottleneck            : 1.3.8\\r\\nfastparquet           : 2024.2.0\\r\\nfsspec                : 2024.3.1\\r\\ngcsfs                 : 2024.3.1\\r\\nmatplotlib            : 3.8.3\\r\\nnumba                 : 0.59.1\\r\\nnumexpr               : 2.9.0\\r\\nodfpy                 : None\\r\\nopenpyxl              : 3.1.2\\r\\npyarrow               : 15.0.2\\r\\npyreadstat            : 1.2.7\\r\\npython-calamine       : None\\r\\npyxlsb                : 1.0.10\\r\\ns3fs                  : 2024.3.1\\r\\nscipy                 : 1.12.0\\r\\nsqlalchemy            : 2.0.29\\r\\ntables                : 3.9.2\\r\\ntabulate              : 0.9.0\\r\\nxarray                : 2024.2.0\\r\\nxlrd                  : 2.0.1\\r\\nzstandard             : 0.22.0\\r\\ntzdata                : 2024.1\\r\\nqtpy                  : None\\r\\npyqt5                 : None\\r\\n\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n',\n",

Even when specifying `dtype=str`, pure numeric strings are being converted to numeric type.  Additionally, pure numeric strings starting with multiple zeros lose the leading zeros in the resulting DataFrame. This behavior is unexpected as I would like to preserve the original format of the numeric strings as text. \\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nThe example demonstrates reading a CSV file with different engines. It is expected that `pyarrow` engine should get the same DataFrame as `c` engine and `python` engine when using `dtype=str`. It should output the following texts. \\r\\n```text\\r\\n# This is read by pyarrow engine.\\r\\n  sample_name case_id sample_id sample_type\\r\\n0    sample_1       1      1001           T\\r\\n1    sample_2       2      1002           T\\r\\n# This is read by c engine.\\r\\n  sample_name case_id sample_id sample_type\\r\\n0    sample_1   00001  00001001           T\\r\\n1    sample_2   00002  00001002           T\\r\\n# This is read by python engine.\\r\\n  sample_name case_id sample_id sample_type\\r\\n0    sample_1   00001  00001001           T\\r\\n1    sample_2   00002  00001002           T\\r\\n```\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit                : d9cdd2ee5a58015ef6f4d15c7226110c9aab8140\\r\\npython                : 3.12.2.final.0\\r\\npython-bits           : 64\\r\\nOS                    : Linux\\r\\nOS-release            : 6.5.0-26-generic\\r\\nVersion               : #26~22.04.1-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Tue Mar 12 10:22:43 UTC 2\\r\\nmachine               : x86_64\\r\\nprocessor             : \\r\\nbyteorder             : little\\r\\nLC_ALL                : None\\r\\nLANG                  : None\\r\\nLOCALE                : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\n\\r\\npandas                : 2.2.2\\r\\nnumpy                 : 1.26.4\\r\\npytz                  : 2024.1\\r\\ndateutil              : 2.9.0\\r\\nsetuptools            : 69.5.1\\r\\npip                   : 24.0\\r\\nCython                : None\\r\\npytest                : None\\r\\nhypothesis            : None\\r\\nsphinx                : None\\r\\nblosc                 : None\\r\\nfeather               : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\r\\nlxml.etree            : 5.1.0\\r\\nhtml5lib              : None\\r\\npymysql               : None\\r\\npsycopg2              : None\\r\\njinja2                : 3.1.3\\r\\nIPython               : 8.22.2\\r\\npandas_datareader     : None\\r\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\r\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\r\\nbs4                   : 4.12.3\\r\\nbottleneck            : 1.3.8\\r\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\r\\nfastparquet           : None\\r\\nfsspec                : None\\r\\ngcsfs                 : None\\r\\nmatplotlib            : None\\r\\nnumba                 : None\\r\\nnumexpr               : 2.9.0\\r\\nodfpy                 : None\\r\\nopenpyxl              : None\\r\\npandas_gbq            : None\\r\\npyarrow               : 11.0.0\\r\\npyreadstat            : None\\r\\npython-calamine       : None\\r\\npyxlsb                : None\\r\\ns3fs                  : None\\r\\nscipy                 : 1.12.0\\r\\nsqlalchemy            : None\\r\\ntables                : None\\r\\ntabulate              : 0.9.0\\r\\nxarray                : None\\r\\nxlrd                  : None\\r\\nzstandard             : 0.22.0\\r\\ntzdata                : 2024.1\\r\\nqtpy                  : None\\r\\npyqt5                 : None\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n',\n",
